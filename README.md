# Meetup-Registration
Seminar registration really requires an information system to regulate the amount of data for participants who register for the seminar, as well as save the data into a recap for the seminar organizers.

<h1>Suggestion </h1>
With a system that is quite complete and systematic, it is possible that there are still many deficiencies in our system. We hope that the suggestions and input we receive can develop our system better and can be used for the wider community.
